# k-mer set compression (with counts)

## Goal
Comparing the compression performance of some tools 
that encode sequences of nucleotides of length k (a parameter to set).

## What is this?
This is a bash script that automates boring stuff like setting 
parameters and execute many programs.

## Setup
This script suppose to have all the binaries needed in 
`${HOME}/bio-bin/` or in your `$PATH` anyway.
You may need to modify the setup function according to 
your binary locations.

## Run
Simply run `./run.sh` and pray to have no error :)
